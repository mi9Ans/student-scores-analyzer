# 📊 Student Scores Analyzer (Python Project)

This project analyzes student scores using Python. It calculates individual averages, checks pass/fail status, identifies the topper using a lambda function, and displays top performers in a bar chart. Results are saved to CSV for external use.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Object-Oriented Python (`Student` class)
- Uses `pandas` for data handling
- Uses `lambda`, `max()`, and `sorted()` for logic
- Pass/Fail checker
- Matplotlib bar chart for top performers
- Saves summary to `.csv`
- Final summary report (total passed, failed, percentage)

## 🧠 Skills Practiced

- Python functions & classes  
- DataFrame logic with `.iloc`  
- Lambda expressions  
- Bar charts with `matplotlib`  
- Exporting to CSV with `pandas`
